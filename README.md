# New Neighborhood-based Optimization Method

### Purpose
To propose a new optimization algorithm named Incremental Grid Search Optimization (IGSO). 

### Notes
The proposed algorithm is part of a final project for Optimization Methods class, where an optimization based on grid neighborhood system for continuous solution space is applied. IGSO's main ability is being able to handle optimization (finding min/max) of non-differentiable functions.
